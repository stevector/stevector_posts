Last month at Drupalcon Portland I gave <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/1458">a presentation on CTools plugins</a> along with <a href="https://twitter.com/pcambra">Pedro Cambra</a>. My half of the presentation focuses on working with existing plugins in <a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels">the Panels module</a>. Panels has one of the steeper learning curves in Drupal. Its complexity presents a challenge when debugging. I breakdown the Panels workflow into its component plugins and discuss the purpose of the plugin types.

And we framed the presentation with haikus.

Each section included a haiku to distill the topic to a more approachable state. So the explanation of access plugins began with the haiku:
<blockquote>Give it a context
And some configuration.
Get back TRUE or FALSE.</blockquote>
Watch the video on YouTube or go straight to <a href="http://stevector.github.io/plugin-haikus/">the slides</a> to see the haikus along with deeper explanations. If you like the poems, <a href="https://twitter.com/DrupalHaikus">follow @DrupalHaikus on Twitter</a>.
